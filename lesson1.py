#rules for creating variable names
# 1. use meaninful words e.g tax instead of t, tax_local instead of tax1
# 2. Do not space words or use an undescore e.g basic_salary_october e.g

basic_salary_october = 40000
tax_foreign = 89000
tax_local = 8900

print(basic_salary_october)
print(tax_foreign)
print(tax_local)
